              Learning to code unlocks the incredible world of technology for
              your children. Instead of just being consumers, they can become
              creators. Have you noticed how those who create technology often
              shape the world? Think about Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and
              Twitterâ€”billion-dollar companies that started as simple apps.
              Their founders, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Jack
              Dorsey, all learned to code before they turned 15. Equip your kids
              with the skills they need to shape the future.
